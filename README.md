# aydio - the innovative monetisation startup

## What is aydio?
In short - instead of paying for content through ads, we present users with an option to go ad free on sites using aydio by contributing their data to our growing data network.
1. A user accesses a site and is presented with this popup:
2. If the user chooses the ad option, no more of our code is ran and the user is presented the normal experience they would recieve with ads from any normal source like AdSense. If the user chooses no ads, our code is loaded and we track metrics that our partners find interesting, this will then also mean that no tracking or advertising code is ran and the user can experience a faster and more seamless experience for free.
3. Everyone wins. Site owners will improve RPM and users get a better experience for free.
